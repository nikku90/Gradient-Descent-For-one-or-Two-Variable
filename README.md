# Gradient-Descent-For-one-or-Two-Variable
In this notebook we will see how Gradient descent algorithm works


Gradient Descent Algorithm is a optimization algorithm works on backend of multiple algorithm in data science to optomize the cost function. This algorithm convergece the cost function into global Minima. In this python notebook we will see how this algorithm converg to global minima visually.
